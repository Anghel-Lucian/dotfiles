Dotfiles for various tools I use: `tmux`, `i3` and `i3blocks`.

`.bashrc` is written to work with `Node.js` and `nvm` installed.

Screenshot support in i3 requires `scrot` package (`sudo apt install scrot`).

Neovim config requires `ripgrep` for fuzzy file content search to work. Install Packer
and run `:PackerSync` to install all the plugins. Make sure to shoutout all files
if some configs don't work.
